# YouTube_Questions
This is a project based on the Langchain course with Kahab Kumar on the Freecodecamp YouTube channel. I am thankful for the content. In this course, I learned how to send a question to the OpenAI API and receive a response, utilize Wikipedia for information, or use a YouTube video to answer a question.
